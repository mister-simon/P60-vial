# P60-vial
Vial configs for my 60 key ortholinear keyboard.

## What I want from my layout

- Toggle between qwerty and colemak-dh
- Backspace without fully rearranging hands
- Symbols in "familiar" places
  - ISO-like arrangement
- Arrow keys available for moving windows / chunks of code around
  - Generally, arrow keys available with and without layer switching
- Numpad layer
- Right hand thumb for space
- Avoid complex chords
- Avoid tap actions which block a key being registered

## Current files

- Init
  - The initial setup of my board with some tweaks for my own sanity. An easy template to try new things from.

- Main
  - The setup I'm actually using and have active muscle memory for.

- Miryoku
  - An attempt at moulding [the Miryoku layout](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference) to my own preferences / OLKB matrix.

- Wide no left col
  - Loses both left and right column of modifiers (including esc, left shift, enter) in favour of more space for symbols.
